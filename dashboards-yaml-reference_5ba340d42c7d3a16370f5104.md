## Overview

This document is the reference of the Dashboard YAML grammar used for
defining `dashboards` in Semaphore 2.0.

A Semaphore 2.0 `Dashboard` is a place where you can define `widgets` in order
to overview the operations that take place under the current Semaphore 2.0
organization.

More specifically, a `widget` is used for watching the activity of pipelines
and workflows according to certain criteria that are defined using filters
that can help you narrow down the displayed information.

Each dashboard is associated to a given organization. Therefore, in order to
view a specific dashboard you should be connected to the organization the
dashboard belongs to.


## list_workflows



## list_pipelines



## Properties

### apiVersion

The `apiVersion` property specifies the API version of the Dashboard YAML
grammar that will be used in the current document. Different API versions
might have different features.

The list of valid values for `apiVersion`: `v1alpha`.

### kind

The `kind` property defines the purpose of the YAML file. For a YAML file that
will be used for defining a Dashboard, the value of the `kind` property should
be `Dashboard`.

The list of valid values for `kind`: `Dashboard`.

### metadata

The `metadata` property defines the metadata of the Dashboard YAML file.
The list of supported properties includes `name`, `title`, `id`,
`create_time` and `update_time` but this might change in future versions.

#### name in metadata

The `name` property holds the name of the dashboard as it will appear on the
URL of the dashboard and should be unique among the dashboards of an
organization.

The value of `value` should contain lowercase letters, dashes and numbers only.

#### title in metadata

The `title` property holds the title of the Dashboard as it will appear on the
UI of Semaphore 2.0 and it can contain any characters you want.

#### id

The value of the `id` property is automatically generated and assigned by
Semaphore 2.0 and is unique among all dashboards. It should not be changed by
the user.

#### create_time

The value of the `create_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format.

#### update_time

The value of the `update_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. This value is automatically updated each
time you make changes to a dashboard.

### spec

The `spec` property is used for holding the `widgets` property.

#### widgets

The `widgets` property holds a list of widgets. Each widget
defines the actual information that will be displayed on Semaphore 2.0 UI using
the `name`, `type` and `filters` properties.

##### name in widgets

The `name` property used in each item of the `widgets` list defines the name of
a `widget` as it will appear on the UI of Semaphore 2.0.

##### type

The value of `type` defines whether you want your widget to display information
about pipelines or workflows.

The list of valid values for `type`: `list_workflows` and `list_pipelines`.

##### filters

The `filters` property holds a list of items that can help you filter the
output to match certain criteria.

Notice that the `filters` property is compulsory when used with a
`list_pipelines` widget type and optional when used with a `list_workflows`
widget type.

If you are using a `list_worflows` type and you have no filters, the value of
`filters` should be `filters: {}`.

###### project_id

The `project_id` property is compulsory for the `list_pipelines` type of
widgets and optional for the `list_worflows` type of widgets.

The `project_id` property allows to display workflows or pipelines from a
given Semaphore 2.0 project.

You can find the project ID of an existing Semaphore 2.0 project with the help
of the `sem get project <name>` command.

###### branch

The `branch` property allows you to filter the widget output by the branch name
of the GitHub repository of a Semaphore 2.0 project.

Note that the value of the `branch` property should be an exact match and that
there is currently no support for regular expressions in the `branch` property.


<!---
###### github_uid

The `github_uid` property allows you to filter the results by GitHub username
and can only be used with the `list_workflows` type.

There exist a special value for `github_uid`, which is `'{{gitgub_uid}}'` that
is automatically expanded to the GitHub username of the current user.

--->

###### pipeline_file

The `pipeline_file` property, which can only appear in the `list_pipelines` widget type,
allows you to filter the generated output using the filename of the pipeline
file that is being executed. The filename of the
default pipeline is `.semaphore/semaphore.yml`.

## Example

    apiVersion: v1alpha
    kind: Dashboard
    metadata:
      name: my-dashboard
      title: My Dashboard
      id: eb0cc2c7-bbc9-41e4-9e3d-2eb622a673fb
      create_time: "1537445699"
      update_time: "1537445713"
    spec:
      widgets:
      - name: Workflows
        type: list_pipelines
        filters:
          project_id: 7384612f-e22f-4710-9f0f-5dcce85ba44b
      - name: docs projects
        type: list_pipelines
        filters:
          project_id: 0dd982e8-32f5-4037-983e-4de01ac7fb1e
      - name: Using list_workflows
        type: list_workflows
        filters:
          branch: master
      - name: All projects on branch mt/sem-init
        type: list_workflows
        filters:
          branch: mt/sem-init
