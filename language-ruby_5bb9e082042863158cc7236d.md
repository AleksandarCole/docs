## Supported versions

Semaphore uses [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage
Ruby versions. Any version installable with rbenv is supported on
Semaphore. Versions 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 are pre-installed. The default
version is set from `.ruby-version` in your repo. You can change this
by calling `sem-version ruby 2.5.1`. Here's an example:

<pre><code class="language-yaml">blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - sem-version ruby 2.5.1
      jobs:
        - name: Tests
          commands:
            - ruby --version
</code></pre>

## Dependency caching

To avoid installing project dependencies from scratch in every pipeline run,
we can save time by caching and reusing them.
You can use Semaphores `cache` command to store and load a gem bundle.
This requires setting the `BUNDLE_PATH` environment variable. In the following
configuration example, we install dependencies and warm the cache in the first
block, then use the cache in subsequent blocks.

<pre><code class="language-yaml">#.semaphore/semaphore.yml
version: "v1.0"
name: Example Ruby pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: Install dependencies
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: cache bundle
          commands:
            - checkout
            - cache restore v1-bundle-$(checksum Gemfile.lock)
            - bundle install --deployment
            - cache store v1-bundle-$(checksum Gemfile.lock) vendor/bundle

  - name: Tests
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cache restore v1-bundle-$(checksum Gemfile.lock)
      env_vars:
        - name: BUNDLE_PATH
          value: vendor/bundle
      jobs:
        - name: Test all the things
          commands:
            - bundle exec rake test
</code></pre>

## Environment variables

Semaphore doesn't set language specific environment variables like
`RAILS_ENV` or `RACK_ENV`. You should set these at the task level.

<pre><code class="language-yaml">blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      env_vars:
        - name: RACK_ENV
          value: test
      jobs:
        - name: Everything
          commands:
            - bundle exec rake test
</code></pre>

## C-Extensions & system dependencies

Projects may need system packages to install gems like `pg`. Semaphore provides
full `sudo` access so you may install all required packages. Here's an
example of installing the `pg` gem.

<pre><code class="language-yaml">blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libpq-dev
          - gem install pg
      jobs:
        - name: Everything
          commands:
            - bundle exec rake test
</code></pre>
