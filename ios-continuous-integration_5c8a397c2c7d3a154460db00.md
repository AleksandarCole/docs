This is a guide to continuous integration for iOS applications created with Xcode.
Semaphore supports building, testing and deploying Swift, Objective-C and React Native
projects via [macOS Mojave VM image][macos-mojave] and [a1-standard machine
types][machine-types].

iOS support is currently in beta, during which time the service is free to
use. [You can apply for access here][beta-apply].

## Demo project

Semaphore maintains an example iOS Swift project:

- [Demo Swift Xcode project on GitHub][demo-project]

In the repository you will find an annotated Semaphore configuration file
`.semaphore/semaphore.yml`.

The application uses Swift, Xcode and Fastlane.

## Overview of the CI pipeline

The Semaphore pipeline is configured to:

- Run application tests;
- Build the app using [gym][gym], which would generate an `ipa` file signed by
  your developer certificate.

![iOS Xcode CI pipeline](https://github.com/semaphoreci-demos/semaphore-demo-ios-swift-xcode/raw/master/public/ci-pipeline.png)

You can extend the example pipeline to run additional tasks and configuring
beta and release deployment.

## Sample configuration

The following configuration is used in the provided [demo
project][demo-project]:

``` yaml
# .semaphore/semaphore.yml
version: v1.0
name: Semaphore iOS example
agent:
  machine:
    type: a1-standard-4
    os_image: macos-mojave

blocks:
  - name: Run tests
    task:
      env_vars:
        - name: LANG
          value: en_US.UTF-8
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cache restore gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gemfile.lock),gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-,gems-master-
          - bundle install --path vendor/bundle
          - cache store gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gemfile.lock) vendor/bundle
      jobs:
        - name: Fastlane test
          commands:
            - bundle exec xcversion select 10.1
            - bundle exec fastlane ios test

  - name: Build app
    task:
      env_vars:
        - name: LANG
          value: en_US.UTF-8
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cache restore gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gemfile.lock),gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-,gems-master-
          - bundle install --path vendor/bundle
      jobs:
        - name: Fastlane build
          commands:
            - bundle exec xcversion select 10.1
            - bundle exec fastlane certificates refresh_certificates:true
            - bundle exec fastlane build use_temporary_keychain:true
```

## Configuration walkthrough

### Naming your pipeline

In case you connect multiple pipelines with promotions,
the name will help you differentiate between, for example, a CI build phase
and delivery phases.

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Semaphore iOS example
```

### Defining the agent

An agent defines the environment in which your code runs. It is a combination
of one of available machine types and operating system images.

In case of iOS or macOS builds, we want to use one of the Apple [machine
types][machine-types],
coupled with the [macOS Mojave OS image][macos-mojave].

``` yaml
agent:
  machine:
    type: a1-standard-4
    os_image: macos-mojave
```

### Defining blocks

Blocks are the heart of a pipeline and are executed sequentially.
Each block has a task that defines one or many parallel jobs. Jobs define the
commands to execute. Blocks, tasks and jobs are Semaphore's [core
concepts][concepts].

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Run tests
    task:
      env_vars:
        # This environment variable is exported in every job within this block:
        - name: LANG
          value: en_US.UTF-8
      prologue:
        commands:
          - # this runs before every parallel job
      jobs:
        - name: Fastlane test
        commands:
          - # ...
        - name: 2nd parallel job
        commands:
          - # ...
        - name: 3rd parallel job
        commands:
          - # ...
  - name: Build app
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Fastlane app
        commands:
          - # ...
```

### Downloading code

To download your code in a job, use the [`checkout` command][checkout], an [open
source script][checkout-source] provided by Semaphore.

By default this performs a shallow git clone from remote origin. If you want a
full clone which will be cached by Semaphore, use `checkout --use-cache`.

``` yaml
        commands:
          - checkout
```

### Installing dependencies

Semaphore can install dependencies from any supported language.
Using the versatile [cache tool][cache], you can save time by reusing them
across blocks and workflows.

``` yaml
        commands:
          - cache restore gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gemfile.lock),gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-,gems-master-
          - bundle install --path vendor/bundle
          - cache store gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gemfile.lock) vendor/bundle
```

In example configuration, the first command restores dependencies from cache
using partial cache key matching:

1. Ideal scenario is to match `gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gemfile.lock)`.
   This means that we've found dependencies from the current Git branch, and
   current content of dependencies' lock file. `$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH` is one of
   the [environment variables][env-vars] provided by Semaphore in every job.
   [`checksum`][checksum] is a script that returns MD5 sum of provided file.
2. The second best option is to find any previous version of dependencies for
   the current Git branch, using `gems-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-` as key.
3. Last option is to reuse the last available cache from the master branch.

The `cache restore` command will not fail in case of a cache miss. In case of a
cache hit, `bundle install` will complete in about a second.

After installing the dependencies, we store them in cache for reuse in upcoming
blocks and future workflows.

### Selecting Xcode version

You can find the list of currently available versions of Xcode in the [macOS
Mojave image reference][macos-mojave].

``` yaml
        commands:
          - bundle exec xcversion select 10.1
```

### Running tests

Semaphore can run tests of iOS and Mac apps on a simulator or connected device.
If you're using Fastlane, see documentation regarding [fastlane
scan][fastlane-scan].

``` yaml
        commands:
          - bundle exec fastlane test
```

### Building your app

In this example we create a temporary keychain and use it with `fastlane build`.

``` yaml
        commands:
          - bundle exec fastlane certificates refresh_certificates:true
          - bundle exec fastlane build use_temporary_keychain:true
```

### Releasing your app

To manage your developer credentials on Semaphore, use [encrypted
secrets][secrets].

To manage releases, [set up promotions][promotions] to trigger additional pipelines.

## Run the demo project yourself

A good way to start using Semaphore is to take a demo project and run it
yourself. Hereâ€™s how to build the demo project with your own account:

1. [Fork the project on GitHub][demo-project] to your own account.
2. Clone the repository on your local machine.
3. In Semaphore, follow the link in the sidebar to create a new project.
4. Create your secret as per instructions above.
5. Edit any file and push GitHub, and Semaphore will run the CI/CD pipeline.
