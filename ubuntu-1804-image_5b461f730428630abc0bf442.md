The `ubuntu1804` is a customized image based on [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes)
optimized for CI/CD. It comes with a set of preinstalled languages, databases,
and utility tools commonly used for CI/CD workflows. The image can be paired
with any [Linux machine type][machine-types] when defining the [agent][agent]
of your pipeline or block.

The `ubuntu1804` is a virtual machine (VM) image. The user in the environment,
named `semaphore`, has full `sudo` access.

The `ubuntu1804` VM uses an *APT mirror* that is in the same data center as
Semaphore's build cluster, which means that caching packages will have little
effect.

## Using the ubuntu1804 OS image in your agent configuration

To use the `ubuntu1804` OS image, define it as the `os_image` of your agent's
machine.

``` yaml
version: 1.0
name: Ubuntu18 Based Pipeline

agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: "Unit tests"
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Tests
          commands:
            - make test
```

The `ubuntu1804` OS image can be used in combination with all Linux machine
types: `e1-standard-2`, `e1-standard-4`, `e1-standard-8`.

## Toolbox

The `ubuntu1804` comes with two utility tools. One for managing background
services and database, and one for managing language versions.

### Managing Background Services and Databases with sem-service

The `sem-service` is a utility for starting, stopping and getting the status
of background services. Started services will listen on 0.0.0.0 and
their default port. The 0.0.0.0 IP address includes all available network
interfaces. Essentially, you will be using services as if they were natively
installed in the Operating System.

The general form of a `sem-service` command is as follows:

``` bash
sem-service start [mysql | postgres | redis | memcached | mongodb | elasticsearch] [version]
```

Therefore, each `sem-service` command requires at least two parameters: the
first one is the task you want to perform and the second parameter is the name
of the service that will be used for the task. The third parameter is optional
and is the version of the service that you want to start. If no `version` value
is given, a default value will be used according to the following list:

- mysql: The default value is `5.6`
- postgres: The default value is `10.6`
- redis: The default value is `4`
- memcached: The default value is `1.5`
- mongodb: The default value is `4.1`
- elasticsearch: The default value is `6.5.1`

`sem-service` pulls images from Docker Hub and supports all versions that are
available in Docker Hub. You can find the list of available versions at the
following URLs:

- ElasticSearch: <https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/>
- MySQL: <https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/>
- PostgreSQL: <https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/>
- Redis: <https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/>
- MongoDB: <https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/>
- Memcached: <https://hub.docker.com/_/memcached/>

The following are valid uses of `sem-service`:

``` bash
sem-service start redis
sem-service stop redis
sem-service start redis 5
sem-service status postgres
sem-service start postgres 11
sem-service status mysql
sem-service start memcached
sem-service start elasticsearch
sem-service start elasticsearch 6.5.2
sem-service start mongodb
sem-service start mongodb 3.2
```

Credentials:

- The default MySQL username is `root` and password is blank.
- The default PostgreSQL username is `postgres` and password is blank.

Services are not automatically shared across blocks. To do that, start services
within the [prologue](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/50-pipeline-yaml#prologue)
property of each task and populate data as needed.

Example `sem-service` in your pipelines:

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Testing sem-service
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: Databases
    task:
      env_vars:
        - name: DB_NAME
          value: "test"
      jobs:
      - name: MySQL
        commands:
          - sem-service start mysql
          - sudo apt-get install -y -qq mysql-client
          - mysql --host=0.0.0.0 -uroot -e "create database $DB_NAME"
          - mysql --host=0.0.0.0 -uroot -e "show databases" | grep $DB_NAME
          - sem-service status mysql

      - name: PostgreSQL
        commands:
          - sem-service start postgres
          - sudo apt-get install -y -qq postgresql-client
          - createdb -U postgres -h 0.0.0.0 $DB_NAME
          - psql -h 0.0.0.0 -U postgres -c "\l" | grep $DB_NAME
          - sem-service status postgres

      - name: Redis
        commands:
          - sem-service start redis
          - sem-service status redis

      - name: Memcached
        commands:
          - sem-service start memcached
          - sem-service status memcached
```

### Selecting language version with sem-version

The `sem-version` utility is used for changing the version of a programming
language on the executed Virtual Machine (VM).

The supported programming languages are `elixir`, `erlang`, `go`, `java`,
`php`, `ruby`, `python`, `scala` and `node`.

The general form of the `sem-version` utility is:

``` bash
sem-version [PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE] [VERSION]
```

where `[PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE]` is one of `elixir`, `erlang`, `go`, `java`,
`php`, `ruby`, `python`, `scala` and `node`. The value of the `[VERSION]`
parameter depends on the programming language used.

For example, to change Go version to 1.9, use:

``` bash
sem-version go 1.9
```

## Version control

Following version control tools are pre-installed:

- Git (2.x)
