The `ubuntu1804` is a customized image based on [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes)
optimized for CI/CD. It comes with a set of preinstalled languages, databases,
and utility tools commonly used for CI/CD workflows. The image can be paired
with any [Linux machine type][machine-types] when defining the [agent][agent]
of your pipeline or block.

The `ubuntu1804` is a virtual machine image. The user in the environment, named
`semaphore`, has full `sudo` access.

The `ubuntu1804` Virtual Machine uses an *APT mirror* that is in the same data
center as our build cluster, which means that caching packages will have little
effect.

## Using the ubuntu1804 OS image in your agent configuration

To use the `ubuntu1804` OS image, define it as the `os_image` of your agent's
machine.

``` yaml
version: 1.0
name: Ubuntu18 Based Pipeline

agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: "Unit tests"
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Tests
          commands:
            - make test
```

The `ubuntu1804` OS image can be used in combination with all Linux machine
types `e1-standard-2`, `e1-standard-4`, `e1-standard-8`.

## Version control

Following version control tools are pre-installed:

- Git (2.x)
- Git LFS (Git Large File Storage)
- Mercurial (4.5.x)
- Svn (1.9.x)

### Browsers and Headless Browser Testing

- Firefox 60.1
- geckodriver 0.21.0
- Google Chrome 72
- chrome_driver 2.46
- xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer)

Chrome and Firefox both support headless mode. You shouldn't need to do more
than install and use the relevant Selenium library for your language.
Refer to the documentation of associated libraries when configuring your project.

### Docker

Docker toolset is installed and following versions are available:

- Docker 18.06
- docker-compose 1.22.0

### Cloud CLIs

- aws-cli
- eb-cli
- ecs-cli
- gcloud
- kubectl
- heroku

### Network utilities

- httpie
- curl
- rsync

## Databases and services

Databases run in the same environment as your code. You can start a local
database service using the [sem-service](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/54-toolbox-reference#sem-service)
tool:

``` bash
sem-service start mysql
sem-service start postgres
sem-service start redis
sem-service start memcached
sem-service start mongodb
sem-service start elasticsearch
```

Credentials:

- The default MySQL username is `root` and password is blank.
- The default PostgreSQL username is `postgres` and password is blank.

Services are not automatically shared across blocks. To do that, start services
within the [prologue](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/50-pipeline-yaml#prologue)
property of each task and populate data as needed.
