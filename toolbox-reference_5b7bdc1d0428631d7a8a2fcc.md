## Overview

This document explains the use of the command line tools found in the
`https://github.com/semaphoreci/toolbox` repository and are automatically
available to Semaphore 2.0 VM used for executing the jobs of a pipeline.

## Essentials

This section contains the most frequently used tools of the Semaphore 2.0
toolbox.

### libcheckout

#### Description

The `libcheckout` script includes the implementation of a single function
named `checkout()` that is used for replicating the GitHub repository of the
Semaphore 2.0 into the VM used for executing the job of the pipeline.

#### Command Line Parameters

The `libcheckout` script and the `checkout` command require no command line
arguments.

#### Dependencies

The `checkout()` function of the `libcheckout` script depends on the following
three Semaphore environment variables:

   - `SEMAPHORE_GIT_URL`: This environment variable holds the URL of the GitHub
     repository that is used in the Semaphore 2.0 project (`git@github.com:mactsouk/S1.git`).
   - `SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR`: This environment variable holds the UNIX path where the GitHub
     repository will be placed on the VM (`/home/semaphore/S1`).
   - `SEMAPHORE_GIT_SHA`: This environment variable holds the SHA key for the
     HEAD reference that is used when executing `git reset -q --hard`.
   
All these environment variables are automatically defined by Semaphore 2.0.

#### Examples

    checkout

Notice that the `checkout` command automatically changes the current directory
of the VM to the directory defined in the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR` environment
variable.

### sem-service

#### Description

The `sem-service` script is a utility for starting, stopping and restarting
background services with Docker that listen on 0.0.0.0, which includes all the
available network interfaces.

#### Command Line Parameters

The general form of a sem-service command is as follows

    sem-service [start|stop|status] image_name

Therefore, each `sem-service` command requires two parameters: the first one is
the task you want to perform and the second parameter is the Docker image that
will be used for the task.

#### Dependencies

The `sem-service` utility starts background services with docker.

#### Examples

If the first command line argument is invalid, `sem-service` will print its help screen.

	sem-service abc an_image
	#####################################################################################################
	service 0.5 | Utility for starting background services, listening on 0.0.0.0, using Docker
	service [start|stop|status] image_name
	#####################################################################################################

The following are valid uses of `sem-service`:

	sem-service start postgres:9.6
	sem-service start redis
	sem-service start postgres:9.6 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password

### retry

#### Description

The `retry` script is used for retrying a command for a give amount of times at
a given time interval â€“ waiting for resources to become available or waiting
for network connectivity issues to be resolved is the main reason for using
that command.

#### Command Line Parameters

The `retry` bash script supports two command line parameters:

- `-t` or `--times`: this is used for defining the number of retries before
    giving up. The default value is 3.
- `-s` or `--sleep`: this is used for defining the time interval between retries.
    The default value is 0.

#### Dependencies

The `retry` bash script only depends on the `/bin/bash` executable.

#### Examples

	$ retry lsa -l
	/usr/bin/retry: line 46: lsa: command not found
	[1/3] Execution Failed with exit status 127. Retrying.
	/usr/bin/retry: line 46: lsa: command not found
	[2/3] Execution Failed with exit status 127. Retrying.
	/usr/bin/retry: line 46: lsa: command not found
	[3/3] Execution Failed with exit status 127. No more retries.

In the previous example the `retry` command will never be successful because
the `lsa` command does not exist.

	$ ./retry.sh -t 5 -s 10 lsa -l
    ./retry.sh: line 46: lsa: command not found
    [1/5] Execution Failed with exit status 127. Retrying.
    ./retry.sh: line 46: lsa: command not found
    [2/5] Execution Failed with exit status 127. Retrying.
    ./retry.sh: line 46: lsa: command not found
    [3/5] Execution Failed with exit status 127. Retrying.
    total 8
    -rwxr-xr-x   1 mtsouk  staff  1550 Aug 30 10:58 retry.sh

In the previous example, the `retry` script succeeded after three failed tries!
