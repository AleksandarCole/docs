## The_preamble

Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preamble, which is
mandatory and should be present on every `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file you create.
This preamble includes the following four lines:

    version: "v1.0"
    name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:

The `version` property is a string value that shows the version of the
pipeline YAML file that will be used. At the time of writing this, the
current version is 1.0 and therefore this is the value that should be
used.

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to the
pipeline. You will see the `name` property again because it can also be
used for defining the name of a job inside a `jobs` block or the name of
a task section defined using `task`.

## About agent

You can think of the _three_ values under the `agent` property as the
environment (type of container) in which the jobs of the pipeline will
get executed. The `type` property is intended for selecting the machine
(hardware) you would like to use for your builds. The `os_image`
property specifies the operating system and the version of the operation systems that will be used.
Please notice that you cannot use arbitrary values for the `type` and `os_image` properties.

You will most likely need to use `e1-standard-2` as the value of the
`type` property and `ubuntu1804` as the value of the `os_image` property.
