## Overview

This document is the reference of the YAML grammar used for describing the
pipelines of Semaphore 2.0 projects.

The core properties of a Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file are
`blocks`, which appear only once at the beginning of a YAML file, `task`,
which can appear multiple times, `jobs`, which can also be repeated, and
`promotions` that is optional and can appear only once.

Moreover, each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preface part,
which is mandatory and should be present on every Pipeline YAML file you
create. The properties of the preface part are `version`, `name`,
which is the only optional one, and `agent`.

## Properties

## version

The `version` property is a string value that shows the version of the
pipeline YAML file that will be used.

The list of valid values for `version`: `v1.0`.

Example of `version` usage:

    version: v1.0

## name in preface

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to a Semaphore
2.0 project and is optional. However, you should always give descriptive names
to your Semaphore 2.0 projects.

*Note*: The `name` property can be found in other sections for defining the
name of a job inside a `jobs` block or the name of a `task` section defined
using `task`.

Example of `name` usage:

    name: The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project

## agent

The `agent` property requires one additional property named `machine`, that
identifies the environment, that is the hardware of the Virtual machine and the
Operating System of the Virtual Machine, in which the jobs of the pipeline will
get executed.

Example of `agent` usage:

    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804

*Tip*: The `agent` property can be also defined on a [per `task` basis](#agent-in-task).

### machine

The `machine` property, which can only be defined under `agent`, requires two
properties named `type` and `os_image`.

Example of `machine` usage:

    machine:
      type: e1-standard-2
      os_image: ubuntu1804

### type

The `type` property is intended for selecting the machine (hardware) you would
like to use on the Virtual Machine of your builds.

The list of valid values for `type`: `e1-standard-2`.

Example of `type` usage:

    type: e1-standard-2

#### The e1-standard-2 constant

The `e1-standard-2` value used in the `type` property represents a predefined
hardware of the Virtual Machine used for executing jobs in the current
pipeline.

### os_image

The `os_image` property specifies the operating system and the version of the
operating system that will be used.

The list of valid values for `os_image`: `ubuntu1804`.

Example of `os_image` usage:

    os_image: ubuntu1804

#### The ubuntu1804 constant

The `ubuntu1804` value used in the `os_image` property represents the Operating
System of the Virtual Machine used for executing the jobs of the current
pipeline.

### A Preface example

    version: v1.0
    name: The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
     - name: Inspect Linux environment
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Print Envrinment variable
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID

## Blocks

The `blocks` property defines an array of items that hold the elements of a
pipeline. Each element of that array is called a *block* and can have three
properties: `name`, which is optional, `dependencies`, which is also optional,
and `task`, which is compulsory.

### name in blocks

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to a block and is
optional.

If you accidentally name two or more `blocks` items with the same name value,
you will get an error message similar to the following:

> semaphore.yml ERROR:

> Error: "There are at least two blocks with same name: Build Go project"

Semaphore assigns its own unique names to nameless `blocks` items, which are
displayed in the Semaphore 2.0 UI.

### task in blocks

All the items of a `blocks` list have a `task` property that at the current
moment is required.

You will learn about the properties of a `task` item in a while.

### Example of Blocks

    version: v1.0
    name: The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
     - name: Inspect Linux environment
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Print Environment variables
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - echo $HOME

## dependencies

Usually `blocks` are executed sequentially, which means in the order that they
appear in the pipeline YAML file. However, with the use of `dependencies` you
can change that behaviour.

The `dependencies` property defines a list of `blocks` item names on a per
block item basis. This list of `task` names describes the tasks that should be
completed before the task with that list begins its execution.

If any of the `task` items makes use of `dependencies`, then all the `task`
items of the pipeline should use `dependencies`, even if their list is empty.

An empty list of `dependencies` is defined as follows in YAML files:

    dependencies: []

### Properties

The `dependencies` property does not have any other properties.

### Example of dependencies

	version: v1.0
	name: Free topology - complex topology
	agent:
	  machine:
	    type: e1-standard-2
	    os_image: ubuntu1804
    
	blocks:
	  - name: A
	    dependencies: []
	    task:
	      jobs:
	        - name: Job A
	          commands:
	             - echo foo
	        - name: Job B
	          commands:
	             - echo Job B - Block A
    
	  - name: B
	    dependencies:
	        - A
	        - D
	    task:
	      jobs:
	        - name: Job B
	          commands:
	             - echo B
    
	  - name: C
	    dependencies:
	        - B
	    task:
	      jobs:
	        - name: Job C
	          commands:
	             - echo C
    
	  - name: D
	    dependencies: []
	    task:
	      jobs:
	        - name: Job D
	          commands:
	             - echo D
    
	  - name: E
	    dependencies:
	        - B
	    task:
	      jobs:
	        - name: Job E
	          commands:
	             - echo E

In the presented example, block items named `A` and `D` have no dependencies.
Block item `B` depends on both `A` and `D` whereas block item `C` depends on
`B` only. Last, block item `E` depends on `B`. For block item `E` to get
executed, it should wait for block item `B` to finish. However, block item `B`
depends on block items `A` and `D`, which means that until all `B`, `A` and `D`
are done, `E` cannot begin.

## Task

The `task` property that is a compulsory part of each block of a `blocks`
property divides a YAML configuration file into major and distinct sections.
Each `task` item can have multiple `jobs` items, an optional `agent` section,
an optional `prologue` section, an optional `epilogue` section as well as an
optional `env_vars` block for defining environment variables and an optional
`secrets` block for using predefined environment variables from predefined
secrets.

### jobs

A `jobs` item is a property of `task` that allows you to define the commands
that you want to execute.

### agent in task

The `agent` section under a `task` section is optional and can coexist with the
global `agent` definition at the beginning of a Pipeline YAML file. The
properties and the possible values of the `agent` section can be found in the
[agent reference](#agent).

An `agent` block under a `task` block overrides the global `agent` definition.

### secrets

The `secrets` property is used for using existing environment variables from
a secret. This is described in the [The secrets property](#the-secrets-property)
section.

### prologue

A `prologue` block is executed before the commands of each job of a `task`
item.

You can consider the `prologue` commands as a part of each one of the `jobs` of
the same `task` item.

### epilogue

An `epilogue` block is executed after the commands of each `jobs` item of a
`task`.

### env_vars

The elements of an `env_vars` array are name and value pairs that hold the name
of the environment variable and the value of the environment variable,
respectively.

#### Example of env_vars

    version: v1.0
    name: A Semaphore 2.0 project
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Check environment variables
              commands:
                - echo $HOME
                - echo $PI
                - echo $VAR1
          env_vars:
               - name: PI
                 value: "3.14159"
               - name: VAR1
                 value: This is Var 1

The preceding pipeline YAML file defines two environment variables named `VAR1`
and `PI`. Both environment variables have string values, which means that
numeric values that are not natural numbers need to be included in double
quotes.

### Example of task

    version: v1.0
    name: The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Check environment variables
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - echo $HOME
                - echo $PI
                - pwd
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout
          env_vars:
               - name: PI
                 value: "3.14159"

*Caution*: The indentation level of `prologue`, `epilogue`, `env_vars` and
`jobs` properties should be the same.

### Example of a task block with agent

    version: v1.0
    name: YAML file example with task and agent.
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
     - name: Inspect Linux environment
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Learn about SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR
    
     - name: Agent in task
       task:
          agent:
              machine:
                type: e1-standard-2
                os_image: ubuntu1804
          jobs:
            - name: Using agent job
              commands:
                - echo $PATH

## Jobs

The `jobs` items are essential for each pipeline because they allow you to
define the actual commands that you want to execute.

### name in jobs

The value of the optional `name` property is a Unicode string that provides a
name to a job.

Semaphore assigns its own names to nameless `jobs` items, which is what is
displayed in the UI.

*Tip*: It is considered a good practice to give descriptive names to all the
`jobs` and the `blocks` items of a Semaphore 2.0 pipeline.

### commands

The `commands` property is an array of strings that holds the commands that
will be executed for a job.

#### Example of commands

The general structure of a job when using the `commands` property is as follows:

    version: v1.0
    name: The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Check environment variables
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - pwd


### commands_file

The `commands_file` file property allows you to define the path of a plain text
that contains the commands of a job instead of listing them in a `commands` list.

You cannot use both `commands_file` and `commands` for defining a `jobs` item.
Moreover, you cannot have a job properly defined if both the `commands`
and `commands_file` properties are missing.

#### Example of commands_file

The contents of the YAML file that defines the pipeline are as follows:

    version: v1.0
    name: Using commands_file
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
     - name: Calling text file
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Using command_file
              commands_file: file_with_commands
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout

The contents of `file_with_commands` are as follows:

	echo "Command File"
	echo "Exit command_file"

Some information about what happens behind the scenes: Semaphore 2.0
reads the plain text file and creates the equivalent job using a
`commands` block, which is what is finally executed. This means that
the `commands_file` property is replaced before the job is started and a
machine begins its execution.

### env_vars in jobs

A local `env_vars` block can be defined on a per `jobs` basis (scope) in
addition to a `env_vars` block that is defined on a per `task` basis (scope).

If the same environment variable name is defined in a both a local `env_vars`
block and a global `env_vars` block, the value of the local `env_vars` block
will be used in the job that defined the local `env_vars` block.

#### Example of env_vars in jobs

	version: v1.0
	name: Using env_vars per jobs
	agent:
	  machine:
	    type: e1-standard-2
	    os_image: ubuntu1804
    
	blocks:
	  - name: Using Local Environment variables only
	    task:
	      jobs:
	      - name: Job that uses local env_vars
	        commands:
	          - echo $APP_ENV
	        env_vars:
	          - name: APP_ENV
	            value: This is APP_ENV
	          - name: VAR_2
	            value: This is VAR_2 from First Job
    
	  - name: Both local end global env_vars
	    task:
	      env_vars:
	        - name: APP_ENV
	          value: prod
	        - name: VAR_1
	          value: VAR_1 from outer env_vars
	      jobs:
	      - name: Using both global and local env_vars
	        commands:
	          - echo $VAR_1
	          - echo $VAR_2
	          - echo $APP_ENV
	        env_vars:
	          - name: VAR_1
	            value: This is VAR_1
	          - name: VAR_2
	            value: This is VAR_2
	      - name: Second job - no local env_vars
	        commands:
	          - echo $VAR_1
	          - echo $APP_ENV


## Prologue and Epilogue

Each `task` element can have a single `prologue` and a single `epilogue`
element. Both `prologue` and `epilogue` properties are optional.

### The prologue property

A `prologue` block in a `task` block is used when you want to execute certain
commands prior to the commands of each job of that `task`. This is usually the
case with initialization commands that install software, start or stop
services, etc.

Please notice that a pipeline *will fail* if a command in a `prologue` block
fails to execute for some reason.

### Example of prologue

    version: v1.0
    name: YAML file illustrating the prologue property
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
     - name: Display a file
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Display hw.go
              commands:
                - ls -al
                - cat hw.go
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout

### The Epilogue property

An `epilogue` block should be used when you want to execute some commands after
a job has finished, either successfully or unsuccessfully.

Please notice that a pipeline *will not fail* if one or more commands in the
`epilogue` fail to execute for some reason.

### Example of epilogue

      version: v1.0
      name: YAML file illustrating the epilogue property
      agent:
        machine:
          type: e1-standard-2
          os_image: ubuntu1804
      blocks:
       - name: Linux version
         task:
            jobs:
              - name: Execute uname
                commands:
                  - uname -a
            epilogue:
                commands:
                  - df

## The secrets property

A secret is a place where you define and store environment variables
that you do not want to make public in a Pipeline YAML file or in a text file
that is stored in the GitHub repository of your project. A secret is
defined using a different [YAML grammar](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/51-secrets-yaml-reference)
and created using the `sem` command line tool.

The `secrets` property is used for importing all the environment variables
from an existing secret.

If the names of the environment variables from two or more imported secrets
are the same, then the shared environment variables will have the value
that was found in the secret that was imported last.

Additionally, if you try to use a `name` value that does not exist, the
pipeline will fail to compile and therefore execute.

### name in secrets

The `name` property is compulsory is a `secrets` block because it specifies the
secret that you want to import. Please note that the specified secret or
secrets should exist under the active organization.

### Example of secrets

    version: v1.0
    name: Pipeline configuration with secrets
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
      - task:
          jobs:
            - name: Using secrets
              commands:
                - echo $USERNAME
                - echo $PASSWORD
          secrets:
            - name: mysql-secrets

Environment variables defined in a `secrets` property are used like regular
environment variables defined in a `env_vars` block.

## promotions

The `promotions` property is used for *Promoting* (manually triggering) one or more
pipelines using one or more Semaphore 2.0 pipeline YAML files.

Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline YAML file can have a single `promotions` block. The
items of a `promotions` block are called targets and are implemented using the `name`
and the `pipeline_file` properties.

A `promotions` block can have one or more targets.

You can promote a target from the UI at any point, even while the pipeline that
owns that target is still running.

### name in promotions

The `name` property in a `promotions` block is compulsory, defines the name of a
target and is a Unicode string.

### pipeline_file

The `pipeline_file` property of the `promotions` block is a path to another
Semaphore 2.0 pipeline YAML file.

If the `pipeline_file` value is just a plain filename without any directories,
then `pipeline_file` will look for it inside the `.semaphore` directory.
Otherwise, it will follow the path given to it starting from the `.semaphore`
directory.

Each `pipeline_file` value must be a valid and syntactically correct pipeline
YAML file as defined in this document.

### Example of promotions

The contents of the `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` are as follows:

    version: v1.0
    name: Using promotions
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
      - name: ls
        task:
          jobs:
          - name: List contents
            commands:
              - ls -al
              - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
    
    promotions:
      - name: Pipeline 1
        pipeline_file: p1.yml
      - name: Pipeline 2
        pipeline_file: p2.yml

The `promotions` block in the aforementioned `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file
will allow you to promote two other YAML files named `p1.yml` and
`p2.yml`.

The contents of the `.semaphore/p1.yml` are as follows:

    version: v1.0
    name: This is Pipeline 1
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
      - name: Environment variable
        task:
          jobs:
          - name: SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
            commands:
              - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID

Last, the contents of the `.semaphore/p2.yml` are as follows:

    version: v1.0
    name: This is Pipeline 2
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
      - name: List VM Linux version
        task:
          jobs:
          - name: uname
            commands:
              - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
              - uname -a


### auto\_promote\_on

The `auto_promote_on` property is used for automatically promoting a branch of
a `promotions` block according to user specified rules.

The `auto_promote_on` property supports a list of items that can have any
combination of the three supported properties: `result`, `branch` and
`result_reason`.

For a `auto_promote_on` branch to execute, all the used properties must be
true.

#### result

The `result` property accepts a single string value and is used for matching
the result of a pipeline.

The list of valid values for `result`: `passed`, `stopped`, `canceled` and `failed`.

#### branch

The value of the `branch` property is a list. Its items are regular expressions
that Semaphore 2.0 tries to match against the name of the GitHub branch that
is used with the pipeline that is being executed. If one of them is a match,
then the `branch` value is `true`. So, only one of `branch` values is needed
to be a match.

In order for the `branch` value to match the `master` branch only and not
branch names such as `this-is-not-master` or `a-master-alternative`, you should
use `^master$` as the value of the `branch` property. The same rule applies for
matching other words or strings.

The `branch` property understands Perl Compatible Regular Expressions.

#### result_reason

The `result_reason` property accepts a single string value and is connected to
the value of the `result` property.

The list of valid values for `result_reason`: `test`, `malformed`, `stuck`,
`internal`, `user` and `fast_failing`.

Not all combinations of `result` and `result_reason` make sense. For example,
you cannot have `passed` as the value of `result` and `malformed` as the value
of `result_reason`. On the other hand, you can have `failed` as the value
of `result` and `malformed` as the value of `result_reason`.

### Example of auto\_promote\_on

The following pipeline YAML file presents an example use of `auto_promote_on`
and depends on two other pipeline YAML files named `p1.yml` and `p2.yml`:

    version: v1.0
    name: Testing Auto Promoting
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    promotions:
    - name: Master
      pipeline_file: p1.yml
      auto_promote_on:
        - result: passed
          branch:
            - "master"
        - result: failed
          branch:
            - "v2."
          result_reason: malformed
    
    - name: prod
      pipeline_file: p2.yml
    
    blocks:
      - name: Block 1
        task:
          jobs:
            - name: Job 1 - Block 1
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH
            - name: Job 2 - Block 1
              commands:
                - echo Job 2 - Block 1
    
      - name: Block 2
        task:
          jobs:
            - name: Job 1 - Block 2
              commands:
                - echo Job 1 - Block 2
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH
            - name: Job 2 - Block 2
              commands:
                - echo Job 2 - Block 2

According to the specified rules only the `Master` branch of the `promotions`
block can be auto promoted – this depends on the rules of the two items of
the `auto_promote_on` list. However, the `prod` branch of the `promotions`
block has no `auto_promote_on` property so there is no way it can be auto
promoted.

The contents of `p1.yml` are as follows:

    version: v1.0
    name: Pipeline 1
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
      - name: Environment variable
        task:
          jobs:
          - name: SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
            commands:
              - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID

The contents of `p2.yml` are the following:

    version: v1.0
    name: This is Pipeline 2
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
      - name: List VM Linux version
        task:
          jobs:
          - name: uname
            commands:
              - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
              - uname -a

Both `p1.yml` and `p2.yml` are perfectly correct pipeline YAML files that could
have been used as `semaphore.yml` files.

###  A complete .semaphore/semaphore.yml example

The following code presents a complete `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file:

    version: v1.0
    name: YAML file example for Go project
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
     - name: Inspect Linux environment
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Execute hw.go
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - echo $HOME
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR
                - echo $PI
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout
          env_vars:
               - name: PI
                 value: "3.14159"
    
     - name: Build Go project
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Build hw.go
              commands:
                - checkout
                - change-go-version 1.10
                - go build hw.go
                - ./hw
            - name: PATH variable
              commands:
                - echo $PATH
          epilogue:
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_JOB_RESULT
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID

### A .semaphore/semaphore.yml file that uses secrets

    version: v1.0
    name: Pipeline configuration with secrets
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
      - task:
          jobs:
            - name: Using secrets
              commands:
                - checkout
                - ls -l .semaphore
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - echo $SECRET_ONE
                - echo $SECRET_TWO
            - name: Using SECRET_TWO
              commands:
                - checkout
                - echo $SECRET_TWO
                - ls -l .semaphore
    
          secrets:
            - name: mySecrets
            - name: more-mihalis-secrets

### A .semaphore/semaphore.yml file without name properties

Although it is allowed to have `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` files without
name properties, it is considered a very bad practice and should be
avoided.

However, the following sample `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file proves
that it can be done:

    version: v1.0
    name: Basic YAML configuration file example.
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
      - task:
          jobs:
              - commands:
                 - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                 - echo "Hello World!"

## The order of execution

You cannot and you should not make any assumptions about the order the various
`jobs` items of a `task` are going to be executed. This means that the jobs of
a `task` item might not start in the order of definition.

However, the `blocks` items of a `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file, which are
`task` items, are executed sequentially. This means that if you have two `task`
items on a `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file, the second one will begin only
when the first one has finished.

Last, the jobs of a block will run in parallel provided that you have the
required capacity (boxes) available.

### Comments

Lines that begin with `#` are considered comments and are being ignored by the
YALM parser, which is not a Semaphore 2.0 feature but the way YAML files work.
