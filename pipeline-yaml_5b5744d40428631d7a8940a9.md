## The preamble

Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preamble, which is
mandatory and should be present on every `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file you create.


### The version property

The `version` property is a string value that shows the version of the
pipeline YAML file that will be used.

Valid values: `"v1.0"`

### The name property

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to the pipeline.
You will see the `name` property in other sections because it can also be
used for defining the name of a job inside a `jobs` block or the name of
a task section defined using `task`.



## The agent property

The `agent` property requires three additional properties. You can think of the _three_ values under the `agent` property as the
environment (type of container) in which the jobs of the pipeline will get executed.


### The machine property

The `machine` property is required for defining the `type` and `os_image` properties.

### The type property

The `type` property is intended for selecting the machine
(hardware) you would like to use for your builds.

Valid values: `e1-standard-2`

### The os_image property

The `os_image` property specifies the operating system and the version of the operation systems that will be used.


Valid values: `ubuntu1804`


### The e1-standard-2 value

The `e1-standard-2` value


### The ubuntu1804 value

The `ubuntu1804` value


## The blocks property

The `blocks` property


## Preamble example

    version: "v1.0"
    name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:



# Version 2

## The preamble
Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preamble, which is
mandatory and should be present on every `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file you create.
This preamble includes the following seven lines:

# Version 3
## The preamble
Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preamble, which is
mandatory and should be present on every `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file you create.
This preamble includes the following seven lines:

The `version` property is a string value that shows the version of the
pipeline YAML file that will be used. At the time of writing this, the
current version is 1.0 and therefore this is the value that should be
used.

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to the
pipeline. You will see the `name` property again because it can also be
used for defining the name of a job inside a `jobs` block or the name of
a task section defined using `task`.

## The agent property

You can think of the _three_ values under the `agent` property as the
environment (type of container) in which the jobs of the pipeline will
get executed. The `type` property is intended for selecting the machine
(hardware) you would like to use for your builds. The `os_image`
property specifies the operating system and the version of the operation systems that will be used.
Please notice that you cannot use arbitrary values for the `type` and `os_image` properties.

You will most likely need to use `e1-standard-2` as the value of the
`type` property and `ubuntu1804` as the value of the `os_image` property.
