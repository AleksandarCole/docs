The MD code for the previous TOC is the following:

    - [The format](#the-format)
    - [Existing Title](#existing-title)
    - [Issues](#issues)


## The format

Each TOC entry must have the following format:

    [Text for that entry](#existing-title)

- The `Text for that entry` can be anything whereas the `existing-title` must be an exiting title.
- The `#id selector` text must be in lowercase
- In the `#id selector` text you must replace space characters with `-`.

## Existing Title

This will be included in the TOC


## Issues

- It is unknown how to create TOC entries for titles with the same text.
