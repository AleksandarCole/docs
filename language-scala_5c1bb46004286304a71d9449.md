## Supported Scala versions

The supported Scala versions are:

* 2.11.11
* 2.12.6

## Changing Scala version

You can choose the Scala version to use with the help of the
[`sem-version` utility](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/54-toolbox-reference#sem-version).

Choosing to Scala version 2.11 can be done with the following command:

    sem-version scala 2.11
	
In order to go back to Scala 2.12, which is the default version, you should
execute the following command:

    sem-version scala 2.12

## Dependency management

You can use Semaphore's [cache tool](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/54-toolbox-reference#cache)
to store and load any files or Scala libraries that you want to reuse between jobs.

## System dependencies

Scala projects might need packages like database drivers. As you have full `sudo`
access on each Semaphore 2.0 VM, you are free to install all required packages.

## A sample Scala project

The following `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file compiles and executes an Scala
source file using two different versions of the Scala compiler:



The contents of `hw.scala` are as follows:

    object HW {
        def main(args: Array[String]) {
          println("Hello World!")
        }
      }
