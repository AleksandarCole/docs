## Dependency management

You can use Semaphore's [cache tool](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/54-toolbox-reference#cache)
to store and load any files or Scala libraries that you want to reuse between jobs.

## System dependencies

Scala projects might need packages like database drivers. As you have full `sudo`
access on each Semaphore 2.0 VM, you are free to install all required packages.

## A sample Scala project

The following `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file compiles and executes an Scala
source file using two different versions of the Scala compiler:



The contents of `hw.scala` are as follows:

    object HW {
        def main(args: Array[String]) {
          println("Hello World!")
        }
      }
