Semaphore organizations can have unlimited members. Members have different permissions based on their role.

## Owner

The creator of organization is its owner. There cannot be multiple owners, but it is possible to transfer the ownership. In order to do that, please [contact support](mailto:support@semaphoreci.com).

### Project permissions

Owner can:

- See all projects;
- Add projects, if they have admin access to the repository on GitHub;
- Delete projects.

### Owner's area

Owner also has access to the Owner's area, which includes:

#### People management

Owners can:

- **Add new members to organization**. Members can be invited by their GitHub username. New members will be able to enter the organization the first time they sign in with their GitHub accounts. _Note_: If you want someone to have access to a project on Semaphore, you first need to give this person access to the repository on GitHub, and then add them as a member to Semaphore on `ORG.semaphoreci.com/people` page.
- **Remove members from organization**. Upon removal, their access to all projects in the organization will be revoked. Please note that this won't change their permissions on GitHub.

#### Billing management
