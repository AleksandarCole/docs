With Semaphore 2.0 you will only pay for what you actually used and you can
customize your usage according to your team's needs.

## Plans

Once you sign up and create an organization, you are automatically on a
**free plan**. With this plan, you will get $20 free credit every 30 days for
the first organization you create on Semaphore 2.0. If needed, an owner of 
the organization can request a transfer of $20 free credit per month to another organization
he owns by reaching out to [support@semaphoreci.com](mailto:support@semaphoreci.com).

On a **free plan**, wou will also be able to
run 8 jobs in parallel for [each type of machines](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types)
(24 parallel jobs in total):

- 8 e1-standard-2 machines
- 8 e1-standard-4 machines
- 8 e1-standard-8 machines

If you decide to add your credit card, you will be switched to the
**paid plan**. Once you do that, you won’t be charged anything. The first
charge will happen at the end of the billing period which are 30 days long
starting from the moment you created an organization. When you add your credit
card, you will receive $200 gift credit for your organization that you can use
during a 3-month period.

On this plan, you can also run 8 jobs
[per machine](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types) in parallel
by default (total 24 parallel jobs). If you’d like to scale up and run more
than 8 jobs in parallel, you can easily do that by reaching out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).
Please include which type of machine you prefer.

In Semaphore 2.0 all organizations are on monthly plans.

**Note:** If you currently have an annual subscription on Semaphore Classic and
would like to migrate to 2.0, please reach out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).

## Billing page

Billing page is only accessible to the creator of an organization and you can
find it in the Owner’s area of your organization.

Here you can find all the details related to your usage:

1. [Machine types](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types)
2. [Prices](https://semaphoreci.com/pricing) of each machine in dollars per second
3. Number of seconds each machine was used
4. Spendings (per machine and total)

**Note:** In order to see fully updated usage, you should allow for up to
24h to pass.

Your current month's running total is always reduced by $20 you get each month
for your first organization. If you have any discounts, your running total will
be reduced by that, too.
