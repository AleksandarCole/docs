## Supported C versions

Currently the Semaphore Virtual Machines support the following versions of the
`gcc` C compiler:

* gcc 4.8: found as `/usr/bin/gcc-4.8`
* gcc 5: found as `/usr/bin/gcc-5`
* gcc 6: found as `/usr/bin/gcc-6`
* gcc 7: found as `/usr/bin/gcc-7`
* gcc 8: found as `/usr/bin/gcc-8`

The default version of the GCC compiler can be found as follows:

	$ gcc --version
	gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.5-4ubuntu8) 4.8.5
	Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

## Changing gcc version

The following Semaphore 2.0 project selects two different `gcc` versions:

	version: v1.0
	name: Choosing GCC version
	agent:
	  machine:
	    type: e1-standard-2
	    os_image: ubuntu1804
    
	blocks:
	  - name: Change GCC version
	    task:
	      jobs:
	      - name: Select gcc version 6
	        commands:
	          - gcc --version
	          - sudo update-alternatives --set gcc "/usr/bin/gcc-6"
	          - gcc --version
    
	      - name: Select gcc version 8
	        commands:
	          - gcc --version
	          - sudo update-alternatives --set gcc "/usr/bin/gcc-8"
	          - gcc --version

## Dependency Management

As there is no standard way to perform dependency management in C, we will skip
that in this guide.

You can use the `cache` Semaphore 2.0 utility to store and load any files or C
libraries that you want to reuse in other jobs.

## Environment variables

Semaphore 2.0 does not set environment variables related to C so you will have
to define them on your own at the task level.

## System dependencies

C projects might need packages like database drivers. As you have full `sudo`
access on each Semaphore 2.0 VM, you are free to install all required packages.

## A sample C project

The following `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file compiles and executes a C source
file using two different versions of the `gcc` C compiler:

	version: v1.0
	name: Using C in Semaphore 2.0
	agent:
	  machine:
	    type: e1-standard-2
	    os_image: ubuntu1804
    
	blocks:
	  - name: Compile C code
	    task:
	      jobs:
	      - name: Hello World!
	        commands:
	          - checkout
	          - gcc hw.c -o hw_4
	          - ./hw_4
	          - sudo update-alternatives --set gcc "/usr/bin/gcc-8"
	          - gcc hw.c -o hw_8
	          - ./hw_8
	          - ls -l hw_4 hw_8

The contents of the `hw.c` file are as follows:

	#include <stdio.h>
    
	int main(int argc, char **argv) {
		printf("Hello World!\n");
		return 0;
	}
