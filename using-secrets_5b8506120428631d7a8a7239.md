## Overview

This documentation page will demonstrate the use of `secrets` in Semaphore 2.0
projects.

A `secret` is a bucket for keeping sensitive information in the form of
environment variables and small files. Therefore, you can consider a `secret`
as a place where you can store small amounts of sensitive data such as
passwords, tokens or keys. Sharing sensitive data in a `secret` is both
safer and more flexible than storing it using plain text files or environment
variables that anyone can access.

## Quick start

In this section you will learn how to work with secrets on your Semaphore 2.0
projects with the help of the `sem` command line utility.

In order to follow this page you will need to have the `sem`
utility installed on your machine. You can download `sem` by following
these [instructions](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/26-installing-cli).

## How to use sem

The `sem` utility related commands for working with secrets are the following:

* `sem create secrets <secret_name>`: for creating a new empty secret
* `sem create -f aFile.yml`: for creating a new secret based on an existing
    `secrets` YAML file
* `sem edit secrets <secret_name>`: for editing an existing secret
* `sem get secrets`: for listing existing secrets and for listing the contents of an
    existing secret
* `sem apply -f secret_file`: for updating an existing secret using a `secret`
    YAML file.
* `sem delete secrets <secret_name>`: for deleting an existing secret

You will see all these commands in action in a while.

### A quick example

This section will present some everyday `sem` commands that can help you work
with secrets as well as a Semaphore pipeline YAML file that uses an existing
secret.

The following `sem` command creates a new secret under the active organization:

    sem create -f add-secrets.yml

The contents of `add-secrets.yml` are as follows:

    apiVersion: v1beta
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-example-secret
    data:
      env_vars:
        - name: ONE
          value: Secret ONE
        - name: TWO
          value: Secret TWO

You can also execute the following command to create an empty `secret` named
`my-example-secret`:

    sem create secret my-example-secret

You can edit `my-example-secret` using `sem edit secrets my-example-secret`
and make it look like the contents of the `add-secrets.yml` secrets YAML file.

An example pipeline YAML file that uses `my-example-secret` is the following:

    $ cat .semaphore/semaphore.yml
    version: v1.0
    name: Using secrets in Semaphore projects
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
        
    blocks:
      - task:
          jobs:
            - name: My secrets
              commands:
                - echo $ONE
                - echo $TWO
          secrets:
            - name: my-example-secret

So, what is happening here? The `secrets` property allows you to define a list
of existing secrets that you want to import. In this case the name of the
secret is `my-example-secret` – all the contents of `my-example-secret`
will be imported.

Please notice that if the names of the environment variables of two or more
`secrets` are the same, then the shared environment variables will have the
value that can be found in the `secret` that was imported last.

The following command prints all the secret names of the active organization:

    sem get secrets

The `sem get secrets` also shows the age of each `secret`, that is the time
since the last change of any kind in that `secret`.

The following command prints the contents of the `my-example-secret` secret:

    sem get secrets my-example-secret

Last, the following example deletes `my-example-secret`:

    sem delete secrets my-example-secret

### A secrets example that uses files

In this section you will see how to add a file to an existing `secret`.

Imagine that you have a file that you need to use in a `secret` named
`my-example-secret`. The desired file is the following:

    ls -l file.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 mtsouk  staff  299 Sep 12 15:19 file.txt  

Then you will need to execute the following command:

    base64 file.txt

The output of that command will be the base64 encoding of `file.txt` that will
be used in the next step. At this point it is better to copy the generated text
in order to paste it in a while. Note that the bigger the size of the file the
bigger the output of `base64 file.txt`.

Notice that Linux machines require executing `base64 file.txt` as 
`base64 -w 0 file.txt` to prevent line wrapping whereas macOS machines do not.

Execute the next command in order to edit the contents of the
`my-example-secret` secret using your favorite UNIX editor:

    sem edit secrets my-example-secret

Now, you can include that file along with the output of `base64 file.txt` in
the `my-example-secret` secret by adding the following text in it:

    apiVersion: v1beta
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-example-secret
    data:
      env_vars:
        - name: ONE
          value: Secret ONE
        - name: TWO
          value: Secret TWO
    files:
    - path: file.txt
      content: SGVsbG8gU2VtYXBob3JlIDIuMCEK

If the output already has a `files` block with a a `path` and `content` pair,
you will just need to add your own `path` and `content` pair. The value of
`content` should be the output of the `base64 file.txt` command.

If the output has a line that looks like `files: []`, then you should replace
that line with the presented text.

An example pipeline YAML file that uses the file that was created in the
previous `secret` is the following:

    version: v1.0
    name: Using files in secrets in Semaphore 2.0
    agent:
       machine:
         type: e1-standard-2
         os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
    - task:
          jobs:
            - name: Getting file.txt
              commands:
                - checkout
                - ls -l ~/file.txt
                - cd ..
                - cat file.txt
                - echo $SECRET_ONE
          secrets:
            - name: my-example-secret
            - name: ssh-keys

So, by default `file.txt` will be restored in the home directory of the user
of the Virtual Machine (VM) and it will be automatically *decoded* when its
`secret` is included in the `secrets` list of a pipeline YAML file.

## The process in more detail

The process of creating and using a secret involves the following steps:

* Creating a secrets YAML file and importing that secrets YAML file into
    Semaphore using `sem` or creating an empty `secret` using
    `sem create secret` and editing the contents of that secret to match your
    needs
* Using the secret you have just created in a Semaphore project

### A YAML file for creating secrets

Everything that is related with secrets starts from a YAML file that is
specific to secrets and allows you to create new secrets under the current
organization. For the purposes of this documentation page, the YAML file that
is going to be used is named `createSecret.yml` and has the following content:

    $ cat createSecret.yml
    apiVersion: v1beta
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-secrets
    data:
      env_vars:
        - name: SECRET_ONE
          value: "Ca c'est un petite secret"
        - name: SECRET_TWO
          value: "Secret deux"

Each secret YAML file creates a new `secret`, which is a place for
storing secrets, that can contain one or more secrets. You recall an existing
`secret` on your Semaphore projects using its name.

Have in mind that each `secret` is stored under a Semaphore organization and
that in order to use a particular `secret` you should be connected to its
related organization.

You can now import that secret YAML file into Semaphore by executing the
following command:

    sem create -f createSecret.yml

### Another way of creating secrets

The method that is going to be described in this section will create the exact
same `secret` as the previous section with the exact same content but using a
slightly different method.

First, you can create an empty `secret` named `my-secrets` as follows:

    sem create secret my-secrets

You can verify that `my-secrets` is created by looking at the output of the
`sem get secrets` command – `my-secrets` should be included in the output.

Then, you will have to populate that `secret` with data by editing its contents
with the help of the next command:

    sem edit secrets my-secrets

The previous command allows you to edit the contents of `my-secrets` using
your favorite text editor. You will have to add the name and value pairs you
want. Later in in this document you will learn more ways of editing the
contents of an existing `secret`.

Although you can create a `secret` any way you want, there is only one way you
can use the contents of a `secret`, which will be described in the next
section.

### How to tie an existing secret into a pipeline quickly

Imagine that you have the following `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file that does
not uses any `secrets`:

    $ cat .semaphore/semaphore.yml
    version: v1.0
    name: Using secrets in Semaphore
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
      - task:
          jobs:
            - name: Using Secrets
              commands:
                - checkout

If you know that name of one or more secrets, which for the purposes of this
page will be `aws-secrets`, `docker-secrets` and `ssh-keys`, you can quickly
add them to a Semaphore project by including the following lines into its
pipeline YAML file:

          secrets:
            - name: aws-secrets
            - name: docker-secrets
            - name: ssh-keys

After that, the original `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file will look as follows:

    $ cat .semaphore/semaphore.yml
    version: v1.0
    name: Using secrets in Semaphore
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
      - task:
          jobs:
            - name: Using Secrets
              commands:
                - checkout
                - echo $TWO
                - echo $ONE
                - echo $SECRET_ONE
          secrets:
            - name: aws-secrets
            - name: docker-secrets
            - name: ssh-keys

### Showing existing secrets

Getting a list of the secrets that exist under the active organization requires
the execution of the next command:

    sem get secrets

### Showing the contents of an existing secret

You can see the contents of an existing secret as follows:

    sem get secrets my-secrets

The following command can help you get the contents of all the secrets in the
current organization:

    sem get secrets | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n1 sem get secrets

### Updating existing secrets

Updating existing secrets can be also done with the `sem` utility. Imagine that
you have `createSecret.yml` that was defined earlier in this page and you want
to update the value of `SECRET_ONE` into `This is a little secret`. All you
have to do is edit `createSecret.yml` and make it looks as follows:

    $ cat createSecret.yml
    apiVersion: v1beta
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-secrets
    data:
      env_vars:
        - name: SECRET_ONE
          value: "This is a little secret"
        - name: SECRET_TWO
          value: "Secret deux"

After that you will need to execute the following command:

    sem apply -f createSecret.yml

Alternatively, you can edit the contents of a `secret` directly using your
favorite text editor:

    sem edit secrets my-secrets

There is another technique that can be applied when you do not have the
original YAML file and requires the execution of the following three commands:

    sem get secrets my-secrets > /tmp/aFile
    vi /tmp/aFile
    sem apply -f /tmp/aFile

The first command dumps the contents of an existing `secret` into a file, the
second command edits these contents and the third command updates them.

There is nothing unique with this technique - the good thing is that it saves
you from having to remember the YAML file that created the `secret` in case you
want to keep it somewhere, send it to another Semaphore 2.0 user or use it in a
different Semaphore 2.0 project.

### Deleting a secret

Deleting an existing secret along with its contents is as simple as executing
the following command:

    sem delete secrets my-secrets

The only way to recreate a secret that you deleted is to find the secret YAML
file of that secret and execute `sem create`.

### What if you try to use a secret that does not exist

In that case the pipeline will fail to execute.

## An example

The following `secret` defines two environment variables and one file:

    apiVersion: v1beta
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: ssh-keys
    data:
      env_vars:
        - name: SSH_KEY_1
          value: SSH Secret key
        - name: SSH_KEY_2
          value: Secret SSH key TWO
    files:
    - path: file.txt
      content: SGVsbG8gU2VtYXBob3JlIDIuMCEK

## Use cases

This section will present a real world scenarios that use Semaphore 2.0 and
utilize secrets to connect to a server using SSH.

### How to handle a ssh key file

In this section you will learn how to store and retrieve ssh keys as files in
`secrets` in order to connect to a remote SSH server without needing a password
or exchange files securely using SFTP without the need to login first.

The `secrets` YAML file will be as follows:

    apiVersion: v1beta
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: ssh-keys
    data:
      env_vars: []
      files:
      - path: .ssh/server_key
        content: SGVsbG8gU2VtYXBob3JlIDIuMCEK

The pipeline YAML file will be as follows:

	version: v1.0
	name: Using a secret file with a SSH key 
	agent:
	  machine:
	    type: e1-standard-2
	    os_image: ubuntu1804
    
	blocks:
	  - name: Using SSH key files
	    task:
	      jobs:
	      - name: Using server_key
	        commands:
	          - ls -l ~/.ssh
			  - chmod 600 ~/.ssh/server_key
			  - ssh -i ~/.ssh/server_key username@server_name
	      secrets:
	      - name: ssh-keys

### How to store something into S3 bucket -  AWS key&secret  <= env vars

In this section you will learn how to store files or data to a S3 bucket. In
order to do that you will need the following:

* AWS key
* AWK secret

After that you will need to save this data into a secrets YAML file in order
to insert it into Semaphore 2.0. The secrets YAML file that will be used is as
follows:


### Store credentials for accessing docker registry (AWS - env vars, Google - file <= we need file support first)

This section will illustrate how to use credentials for accessing Docker
registry. In order to do that you will need the following data:

* First:
* Second:

After that you will need to save the data into a secrets YAML file, which is
going to be the following:



### Connecting to Kubernetes cluster (Google - file <= we need file support first)

The scenario that is going to be illustrated in this section has to do with
saving files to a Kubernetes cluster. In order to do that you will need to have
the following information at hand:

* First:
* Second:

Then you will need to insert that data into Semaphore 2.0 as secrets. For the
purposes of this documentation page the following secrets YAML file will be
used:
