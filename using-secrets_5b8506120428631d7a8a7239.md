## Overview


## Quick start

In this section you will learn how to work with secrets on your Semaphore 2.0
projects with the help of the `sem` command line utility.

In order to follow this page you will need to have the `sem`
utility installed on your machine. You can download `sem` by following
these [instructions]().

### Example

This section will present some everyday `sem` commands that can help you work
with secrets as well as a Semaphore pipeline YAML file that uses an existing
secret.


### YAML file for creating secrets

Everything that is related with secrets starts from a YAML file that is
specific to secrets and allows you to create new secrets under the current
organization. For the purposes of this documentation page, the YAML file that
is going to be used is the next:



Each secrets YAML file creates a new `secrets` bucket, which is a place for
storing secrets, that can contain one or more secrets. You recall a `secrets`
bucket on your Semaphore project by its name.

Have in mind that each `secrets` bucket is stored under a Semaphore
organization and that in order to use a particular `secrets` bucket you should
be connected to its particular organization.

### How to use sem

The `sem` commands for working with secrets are the following:

    * `sem create -f aFile.yml`:
	* `sem get secrets`: for listing existing `secrets` buckets.
	* `sem describe secrets <secret bucket>`: for listing the contents of an
	   existing `secrets` bucket
	* `sem delete secrets <secret bucket>`: for deleting an existing `secrets`
	   bucket

You will see all these commands in action in a while.

### How to tie it into pipeline quickly


## Creating a secret


## Showing existing secrets


## Updating existing secrets (to be defined)

Updating existing secrets can be also done with the `sem` utility.


## Deleting a secret


## Examples


### How to handle a ssh key (connect to remote server)

In this section you will learn how to store and retrieve ssh keys as secrets
in order to connect to a remote SSH server or exchange files securely using
SFTP.
