## Overview

This document is the reference to the YAML grammar used for describing jobs.

## An example

This reference page will begin with an YAML example as returned by the
`sem get jobs [JOB ID]` command:

    $ sem get jobs 33cbe5af-fafb-424b-b06f-12006929cb08
    apiVersion: v1alpha
    kind: Job
    metadata:
      name: Deploy
      id: 33cbe5af-fafb-424b-b06f-12006929cb08
      create_time: "1539327331"
      update_time: "1539327332"
      start_time: "1539327334"
      finish_time: "1539327340"
    spec:
      agent:
        machine:
          type: e1-standard-2
          os_image: ubuntu1804
      files: []
      envvars:

      - if [ $SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH == "master" ]; then ./deploy_docs.rb; fi

    status:
      state: FINISHED
      result: PASSED
      agent:
        ip: 94.130.207.151
        ports:
        - name: ssh
          number: 57693


## Properties


### apiVersion

The `apiVersion` property defines the version of the YAML grammar that will be
used in the current YAML file. Different versions might have different
features.

The list of values for `apiVersion`: `v1alpha`.

### kind

The `kind` property defines the purpose of the YAML file. For a YAML file that
will be used for defining secrets, the value of the `kind` property should
be `Secret`.

The list of values for `kind`: `Job`.

### metadata

The `metadata` property defines the metadata of the Jobs YAML file and supports
the `name`, `id`, `create_time`, `update_time`, `start_time` and `finish_time`
properties.

Currently, only the `name` property can be changed by the user but this might
change in future versions.

#### name

The value of the `name` property, which is a string, in the `metadata` context
defines the name of the job.

As each job is uniquely identified by its Job ID, multiple jobs can share the
same job name without any problems.

#### id

The value of the id property is automatically generated and assigned by
Semaphore 2.0 and is unique among all jobs. It should not be edited.

#### create_time

The value of the `create_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the time of creation of the job.

#### update_time

The value of the `update_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the last time the job was altered.

#### start_time

The value of the `start_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the time that the job started
to execute.

#### finish_time

The value of the `finish_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the time that the job finished
its execution.

### spec

The `spec` property and its list of properties hold the specification of a job.

#### agent

#### machine

#### type

#### os_image

#### files

#### envvars

The `envvars` property holds a list

##### name

##### value

#### secrets


#### commands

The `commands` property 

The value of the `commands` property is a list of strings, which are commands.

### status

The `status` property
